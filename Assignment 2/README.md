# Assignment 2: Feature Extraction and Feature Selection

## Instructions
1. Make sure the folders of differnt users containing raw sensor data are present in DM folder.
2. Run assignment_2_task_1.m file for task 1
	* This script segments raw data into different classes (gestures). Output contains 10 (gestures) CSVs.
3. Run program_to_select_sensors.m
	* This script is executed for selecting set of sensors on which the different feature extraction algorithms to be applied on.
4. Run assignment_2_task_2.m file for task 2
	* This script applies feature extraction algorithms like Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Standard deviation (STD), Root Mean Square (RMS) and Average (AVG) on the data from Task 1.
5. Run assignment_2_task_3.m file for task 3
 	* This script applies PCA on the feature matrix and plots the graphs.
6. Refer the report for detailed explanation.
